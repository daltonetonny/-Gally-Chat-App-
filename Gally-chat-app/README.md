## 💅 Features We’re Obsessed With:

- 💬 Real-time chat, because we don’t like waiting (duh)
- 🌸 Girly UI with pink pastels, soft bubbles, and extra glam
- 🧚 Typing indicators (so you know your bestie is crafting a masterpiece)
- 💃 Username prompts (customize your identity... or be mysterious 👀)
- 🧁 Cute chat bubbles — because rectangles are too basic
- 👯 Live user presence — see who’s online to gossip with
- 💌 Read receipts (✔️✔️ because we love accountability)
